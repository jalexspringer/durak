    "\n",
    "In the first two posts I will detail the first steps I took to create this game - first purely on the command line and with no AI. The third post will cover machine learning that will build out the opponents, using the [Information Set Monte Carlo Tree Search](http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AIIDE/AIIDE13/paper/viewFile/7369/7595), and the third will focus entirely on bringing a GUI to the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A brief lesson on Durak\n",
    "To paraphrase from the great introduction at [pagat.com](https://www.pagat.com/beating/podkidnoy_durak.html):\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Durak is undoubtedly the most popular card game in Russia. It would hardly be an exaggeration to say that every Russian who plays cards knows this game. \"Durak\" means fool, the fool in this game being the loser - the player who is left with cards after everyone else has run out. The game described on this page is properly called \"Podkidnoy Durak\", which means \"fool with throwing in\". This name refers to the fact that after an attack is begun, it can be continued by \"throwing in\" further cards whose ranks match those already played. It is probably the best-known form of Durak in Russia. The same game is played in Poland under the name Dureń (fool) and in several other East European countries.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Game Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "This game has no winner - only a loser. At the start, each player is dealt six cards, which are played in a series of bouts of attack and defence. When a player's hand is reduced to fewer than six cards it is replenished from the talon of undealt cards. After the talon is exhausted, there is no more replenishment and the aim is to get rid of all the cards from your hand. The last player left holding cards is the loser.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Most important rules\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than go in-depth on the rules (please do check out the above link - it is a great game worth learning!), I will quickly highlight the most relevant points for this post:\n",
    "\n",
    " * The deck is made up of 36 cards - all four suits, and 6-Ace\n",
    " * Each player is dealt 6 cards - at the end of each round their hand will be brought up to 6 if it has less\n",
    " * A trump card is drawn first and laid face-up on the table. The player with the lowest trump in their hand plays first and play proceeds clockwise.\n",
    " * On their turn a player 'attacks' the player to their left with a single card. The defender must then respond with:\n",
    " 1. a higher card from the same suit \n",
    " 2. a trump card (if the attacking card is not trump)\n",
    "\n",
    "If the defender beats the first attack card, the attacker can continue the attack by playing another card. If the defender beats this second attack card too, the attack can be continued with further cards, subject to the following conditions: \n",
    "\n",
    " 1. each new attack card must be of the same rank as some card already played during the current bout - either an attack card or a card played by the defender;\n",
    " 2. the total number of cards played by the attackers during a bout must never exceed six;\n",
    " 3. if the defender had fewer than six cards before the bout, the number of cards played by the attackers must not be more than the number of cards in the defender's hand.\n",
    " 4. The attack cards are placed separately face up in front of the defender, and each card played by the defender is placed face up on top of the card it is beating, slightly offset so that the values of all cards can be seen.\n",
    "\n",
    "The defender succeeds in beating off the whole attack if either: \n",
    "1. the defender has beaten all the attack cards played so far and none of the defender's opponents is able and willing to continue the attack;\n",
    "2. the defender succeeds in beating six attacking cards;\n",
    "3. the defender (having begun the defence holding fewer than six cards) has no cards left in hand, all the defender's cards having been used to beat attack cards.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an attack is beaten off, all the cards played during the bout (the attacking cards and the defender's cards) are thrown face down on a discard heap and are not used again during the play of this deal. The defender becomes the attacker for the next bout, and the player to the new attacker's left is the new defender.\n",
    "\n",
    "If at any stage, the defender is unable to or does not wish to beat one of the attack cards, the defender must pick up all the cards played during the bout - both the attacking cards and the cards used to beat them. All these cards become part of the defender's hand. In addition, the players who were entitled to take part in the attack can give to the defender (face up) any further cards which they could legally have played if the attack had continued. These extra cards must also be added to the defender's hand. The bout is then over. Since the attack has succeeded, the defender does not get a turn to attack. The next attacker is the player to the left of the unsuccessful defender, and the new defender is the player to the left of the new attacker as usual.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Win conditions\n",
    "There is no individual winner in Durak - instead the last player with cards is the loser (and subject to much ridicule!). After the talon is exhausted and no more cards can be drawn, each player works to empty their hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "## On to the code!\n",
